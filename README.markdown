**Amir-X 2013** is a Drupal 7 theme for [amir-x.com](http://amir-x.com/).
Of course I will never finish it in 2013 so it's also 2014.

I use [normalize.css][normalize.css], and [unsemantic][unsemantic] for layout.

[normalize.css]: https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css
[unsemantic]: http://unsemantic.com/

Note that I use two free fonts, and a photo freely available by the CC BY-NC license. The attribution to the photo
is inside page.tpl.php. Thanks!
